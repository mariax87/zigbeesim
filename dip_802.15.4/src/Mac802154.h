/**
 * @class CSMAMacLayer
 * @brief MAC module which provides non-persistent CSMA
 *
 * This is an implementation of a simple non-persistent CSMA. The
 * idea of nonpersistent CSMA is "listen before talk". Before
 * attempting to transmit, a station will sense the medium for a
 * carrier signal, which, if present, indicates that some other
 * station is sending.
 *
 * If the channel is busy a random waiting time is computed and after
 * this time the channel is sensed again. Once the channel gets idle
 * the message is sent. (State of the channel is obtained from SnrEval
 * via Blackboard.)
 *
 * An option of this module is to use a queue. If a packet from the
 * upper layer arrives although there is still another packet waiting
 * for its transmission or being transmitted the new packet can be
 * stored in this queue. The length of this queue can be specified by
 * the user in the omnetpp.ini file. By default the length is 0. If
 * the queue is full or there is no queue (length = 0) new packet(s)
 * will be deleted.
 *
 * @todo Inform upper layers about the full queue!
 *
 * ATTENTION: Imagine the following scenario:
 *
 * Several stations receive a broadcast request packet, usally exactly
 * at the same time. They will all try to answer at exactly the same
 * time, i.e. they all will sense the channel at exactly the same time
 * and start to transmit because the channel was sensed idle by all of
 * them. Therefore a small random delay should be built into one/some
 * of the upper layers to simulate a random processing time!
 *
 * The TestApplLayer e.g. implements such a processing delay!
